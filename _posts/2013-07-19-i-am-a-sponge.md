_According to my PhD advisor, I am a sponge. What does that mean, though?  This
is the purpose of today's article._

I am going to introduce a sort of _Sponge Theory_. This is obviously not about
[SpongeBob][]. This informal theory is actually focused on two core principles:
**learning** and **sharing**, and the order matters.

## Learning

One of the main goals of a sponge (the material) is to **sponge an impervious
surface** in order to clean it. A sponge is [especially good at absorbing water
and water-based solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_(material)). In
other words, a sponge is able to _store_ a large amount of liquid into it.

Obviously, as a human, being a sponge means that you are able to **absorb a lot
of information**. You are interested in various topics (and not only technical
ones). You **read** a lot, everything, all the time. You dig into topics that
sound cool to you. You enjoy learning new things and you try to keep you up to
date, even on things that you don't use to do.

Also, an interesting point about [sponges as
animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge) is that they **filter the water
they absorb**. That is how they **feed** themselves. It is similar to you when
you sort all the information you get. You certainly don't agree with everything
you read. Being able to distinguish useful information is tricky though, and it
depends on various parameters such as the context in which you are living,
tastes, aspirations, etc. But I am digressing...

Behaving like a sponge is not only about swallowing and filtering information.

## Sharing

As I said, a sponge is not only about holding water-based solutions. You can
**squeeze sponges in order to get the absorbed water** (please, don't do that
with animals!). That is the second characteristic of a sponge, it is able to
return what it contains.

You love **sharing** things you learned, either by talking to your friends,
writing, teaching, tweeting, etc. For instance, I read a lot of RSS feeds and
weekly mailing lists and I tend to [tweet](https://twitter.com/couac) about
things that I consider relevant. [I also teach at the
University](/2013/06/07/teaching-is-the-best-way-to-learn/) from time to time.

For me personally, it is not too different than the
[Open](/2012/01/16/did-i-tell-you-open-source-was-awesome/)
[Source](/2013/07/04/on-open-sourcing-libraries/) world. When I start to use an
Open Source project, I learn about its internals and very often I contribute
back (in various ways).

## Conclusion

Being a sponge is all about **learning** and **reading** a lot, _i.e._ being
interested in plenty of topics, and then **being able to share relevant
information**.

Is it bad? _No._ I believe that I am lucky, and you should too. Being curious is
important, being able to communicate clearly is even more important!  No matter
how technically "strong" you are, if you are not able to explain what you are
doing or if you can't discuss with your teammates, you are certainly not a "good
fit" for most teams.

Be curious, learn new things, then talk to your teammates. You will become more
valuable over time. People will also naturally come to you to seek advice or
simply share their new shiny things with you.
