Today was my first day at [Michelin](https://www.michelin.com/en/) and that's
a significant turning point in my life.

I just started a **PhD in software testing** and verification. I'll be doing
research on **optimizing and reusing tests** for applications controlling
production machines in factories, using a [model-based testing][] approach.
That's a terrific challenge!

I will also be teaching PHP and Symfony at [IUT de Clermont-Fd](https://iut.uca.fr/).
Because I will be quite busy this year, I decided to close down my own company
and dedicate my free time to Open Source.

Last but not the least, I wish you a **Happy New Year** and **all the best**
for 2013!
