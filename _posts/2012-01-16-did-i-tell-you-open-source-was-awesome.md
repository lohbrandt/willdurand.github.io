A few months ago, my father offered me a Karotz (the new Nabaztag) for my
birthday. At the same time, I started to learn how to write a
[Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) plugin, and I knew this kind of rabbit could
be programmed. That's why I decided to write a
[Karotz-Plugin](https://github.com/willdurand/Karotz-Plugin).

As an Open Source Software enthusiast, I published my code on GitHub right at
the beginning. The plugin was in a work in progress state but quite usable.
Unfortunately, I was unable to improve it for weeks after the initial
publication.

When I got some free time to work on it, I saw my repository had been forked.
Surprise! Someone improved my work and published it as an [official Jenkins
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Karotz+Plugin). Wonderful!

I pulled the repository, and learned a lot from the developer who worked on the
plugin. Isn't that awesome? First, my code has been reused. Second, I learned
new things. Oh, and I got an awesome plugin for Jenkins and my Karotz! ðŸ˜Ž

To summarize, it sounds like a really good idea to [open source
everything](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html),
even if it's a draft/work in progress or even an idea. Someone could find this
idea quite amazing and could contribute to it. Thanks to [GitHub][], open
sourcing something is really really easy these days :)
