Pretty printers are tools used to format textual content according to a set of
stylistic conventions. [Prettier][], [black][], [rustfmt][] are great examples
of such tools, which we call "code formatters" because they are applied to
source code. Users can usually specify the maximum line length and the type of
indentation (spaces or tabs) among other things but those two are responsible
for endless debates in our industry ðŸ¤·.

After a ["I wonder how that works"][works-tweet] moment, I researched different
ways to implement a code formatter and stumbled upon ["A prettier
printer"][wadler] authored by Philipp Wadler. This paper introduces an
_Intermediate Representation_ (IR) used to format content that can then be
printed with multiple possible layouts. This is the foundation of some popular
code formatters like Prettier (see also: [Prettier's intermediate
representation][prettier-ir]).

## How does Wadler's algorithm work?

A code formatter takes some code as input, parse it and translate the result
into a more beautiful version of the code. The parsing step usually generates an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), from which we can derive an intermediate
representation as presented in Wadler's paper.

Most implementations based on this paper use two possible layouts: _flat_ and
_broken_, controlled by the user-defined line length (a.k.a. "print width").
The code formatter should try to append as much content as possible on the same
line (_flat_ layout) and, when that isn't possible, the _broken_ layout, which
describes how to break the content on multiple lines, should be preferred.

### Example: pretty-printing JavaScript

In order to better understand how things work, let's take an example with the
JavaScript function definition below, taken from [my very own implementation of
Wadler's algorithm in JS][demo-project], which we are goint to format with that
same implementation:

```js
const renderDocument = (doc, fits = DEFAULT_FITS, indentPrefix = DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX) => {}
```

In order to format this code, we first need to parse it. Using the JavaScript
parser [`espree`][espree], we get the following AST (some properties have been
removed for brevity):

```js
Node {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    Node {
      type: 'VariableDeclaration',
      kind: 'const',
      declarations: [
        Node {
          type: 'VariableDeclarator',
          id: Node {
            type: 'Identifier',
            name: 'renderDocument'
          },
          init: Node {
            type: 'ArrowFunctionExpression',
            params: [
              Node {
                type: 'Identifier',
                name: 'doc'
              },
              Node {
                type: 'AssignmentPattern',
                left: Node {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  name: 'fits'
                },
                right: Node {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  name: 'DEFAULT_FITS'
                }
              },
              Node {
                type: 'AssignmentPattern',
                left: Node {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  name: 'indentPrefix'
                },
                right: Node {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  name: 'DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX'
                }
              }
            ],
            body: Node {
              type: 'BlockStatement',
              body: []
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's walk through the IR generation now. Skipping the `Program` node (which
represents the entire source code), we want to start pretty-printing a variable
declaration (`VariableDeclaration` and `VariableDeclarator` nodes).

### A simple IR

We are only interested in the first part of our input for now, which is
essentially the JavaScript code shown below where the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of
the declaration has been replaced with `...`. We'll get back to that part later.

![](/images/posts/2021/07/code-rhs.webp)
{:.can-invert-image-in-dark-mode}

In the meantime, this is convenient because it makes the intermediate
representation simple: it is a list of strings. A list implies concatenation of
all the items and a string is rendered as is.

```js
// The JavaScript array below is our IR!
['const ', 'renderDocument', ' = ', '...', ';']
```

```js
// This is the result of our IR once rendered:
const renderDocument = ...;
```

Note the semi-colon at the end, which isn't part of the input. When walking the
JavaScript AST, we produce IR specifically for JavaScript. This is why the
translation logic can append a semi-colon to `VariableDeclaration`. While the IR
"building blocks" are generic, the parsing and translation layers are
language-specific. [Here is an example of translation logic for
XML][xml-printer].

### Describing different layouts

The RHS is an `ArrowFunctionExpression` and we want the pretty output to be
rendered differently depending on the print width value because such functions
might have long parameter names, default values, etc. The idea is to print all
the arguments of the function on the same line if the total width is less than
the print width, otherwise we want to print each argument on its own line. The
IR should describe these two options, without having to specify actual values.

The `group` function (Prettier calls it a "command") is used to describe content
that should be kept on a single line (like concatenation above) but, if it does
not fit, should be broken at specific locations. These locations are defined
with different _lines_:

- `HARDLINE`: specify a line break that is always included in the output, even
  if the expression does not fit on a single line
- `LINE`: specify a line break. If an expression fits on one line, the line
  break will be replaced with a space
- `SOFTLINE`: specify a line break. The difference from `LINE` is that if the
  expression fits on a single line, it will be replaced with nothing (`NIL`)

We want to break after each function argument so `LINE` looks like a good fit.
Let's create a group and add `LINE` between each parameter (name, default value
if any, and comma).

```js
[
  // This is what we had before.
  "const ", "renderDocument", " = ",

  // This is NEW!
  {
    type: "group",
    contents: [
      "(",
      "doc", ",",
      LINE,
      "fits", " = ", "DEFAULT_FITS", ",",
      LINE,
      "indentPrefix", " = ", "DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX",
      ")", " => ", "{", "}",
    ]
  },

  // This is what we had before.
  ";"
]
```

This would produce the following pretty outputs:

```js
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| <- 80 chars (broken layout was used)
const renderDocument = (doc,
fits = DEFAULT_FITS,
indentPrefix = DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX) => {};
```

```js
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| <- 120 chars (flat layout was used)
const renderDocument = (doc, fits = DEFAULT_FITS, indentPrefix = DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX) => {};
```

Ugh! The _broken_ layout version isn't pretty. We should probably break _after_
the opening parenthesis using a `SOFTLINE`, align all the arguments with one
level of indentation and probably break before the closing parenthesis as well.

We can use a new function named `nest()` that will change the current
indentation level. This abstraction allows to later render the same input with 2
spaces, 4 spaces or even tabs. Indentation is only updated after a hard line,
which is why we don't have to specify that it only applies to the _broken_
layout.

Here is the final IR of our function:

```js
[
  "const ", "renderDocument", " = ",
  {
    type: "group",
    contents: [
      "(",

      // This is NEW!
      {
        type: "nest",
        indent: 1,
        contents: [
          SOFTLINE,
          "doc", ",",
          LINE,
          "fits", " = ", "DEFAULT_FITS", ",",
          LINE,
          "indentPrefix", " = ", "DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX",
        ],
      },
      // This is NEW!
      SOFTLINE,

      ")", " => ", "{", "}",
    ],
  },
  ";",
]
```

### The renderer

The [logic to render the IR to pretty content][renderer] is generic because the
intermediate representation contains all the needed information. When the
renderer finds a `group` (see [here][renderer-group]), it will measure the
length of the output when its content is appended on the same line. If this
length is lower than the print width, that's what gets rendered, otherwise the
renderer switches to the _broken_ layout.

`LINE` and `SOFTLINE` are implemented with a `flatChoice` function under the
hood, which is defined as follows:

```js
{
  type: 'flat-choice',
  whenBroken: '<used when layout is broken>',
  whenFlat: '<used when layout is flat>'
}
```

```js
// This is how `LINE` is defined in my implementation.
const LINE = flatChoice(HARDLINE, " ");
```

[There are other functions][other-functions] but `group` and `flatChoice` are
the ones used to describe multiple layouts and therefore very important.

The IR presented in this article gives us some rendering configuration options
"for free":

1. the desired print width: used to determine when to use the _broken_ layout
   (which is used by a [`fits()` function][fit-fn] under the hood)
2. the "type" of indentation: used when the indentation level changes. With
   `nest()`, the IR tells the renderer to indent or dedent the content that
   follows by _N_ levels. The renderer is free to use [any number of spaces or
   tabs for a single indentation level][default-indent]
3. the control character to use to indicate the end of a line: while we probably
   always want `\n`, it could be [any other character][default-newline]

### Results

Rendering the full intermediate representation shown previously would give
different outputs depending on the print width value:

```js
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------| <- 80 chars
const renderDocument = (
  doc,
  fits = DEFAULT_FITS,
  indentPrefix = DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX
) => {};
```

```js
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| <- 120 chars
const renderDocument = (doc, fits = DEFAULT_FITS, indentPrefix = DEFAULT_INDENT_PREFIX) => {};
```

## It is more complicated than that.

Is it _that_ simple? **No.**

I have been lying to you! Did you see an example with a comment? Or with
multiple logical blocks? This is where things start to be complicated.

### Empty lines

Let's consider the example thereafter, which has two "logical blocks". First, we
have two variables defined and grouped together and then a `console.log` call:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;

console.log(a + b);
```

Most users will naturally want to keep the blank line between the two blocks and
no one will like tools that produce the following output:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
console.log(a + b);
```

In order to keep logical blocks separated, we need extra logic to determine
whether, after each statement, there is one or more blank lines. If that's the
case, we can introduce a `HARDLINE` in the IR, which will also collapse multiple
blank lines into a single one ([here][js-empty-line] is how I implemented it for
JS).

Here is a quote from the Prettier docs:

> It turns out that empty lines are very hard to automatically generate. The
> approach that Prettier takes is to preserve empty lines the way they were in
> the original source code. There are two additional rules:
>
> - Prettier collapses multiple blank lines into a single blank line.
> - Empty lines at the start and end of blocks (and whole files) are removed.
>   (Files always end with a single newline, though.)

Depending on the programming language or parser (more on that in the next
section), this might not be too difficult. As for comments, this is a completely
different story!

### Comments

First, most parsers aren't lossless. ASTs are by definition, well... _abstract_.
Comments are usually not included in ASTs and when they are present, they aren't
attached to nodes. This is a problem because where should comments be placed?

We can try to reattach comments to AST nodes if the parser provides locations or
we could use a lossless parser like [rowan][].  Prettier provides a framework to
handle comments and it is a lot better than what I implemented to [reattach
comments][js-reattach-comments].

Here is another quote from the Prettier docs:

> When it comes to the content of comments, Prettier canâ€™t do much really. [...]
>
> Then thereâ€™s the question of where to put the comments. Turns out this is a
> really difficult problem. Prettier tries its best to keep your comments
> roughly where they were, but itâ€™s no easy task because comments can be placed
> almost anywhere.

### Idiomatic patterns

The third constraint that we have when building a code formatter is to fine-tune
the pretty output to respect some popular patterns. So far, we've seen how to
render the same content depending on the print width but we could go further and
have specific layouts depending on the code itself.

Let's take an example with curried arrow functions (see [this Prettier
patch][curried-patch]):

```js
// This is the input, which looks quite good already.
const currying =
  (argument1) =>
  (argument2) =>
  (argument3) =>
  (argument4) =>
  (argument5) =>
  (argument6) =>
    foo;
```

With some trivial modifications to my implementation (required because the JS
formatter in my demo project does not support _all_ JS syntaxes), this is how it
would be pretty-printed:

```js
const currying = (argument1) => {
  return (argument2) => {
    return (argument3) => {
      return (argument4) => {
        return (argument5) => {
          return (argument6) => {
            return foo;
          };
        };
      };
    };
  };
};
```

Prettier used to print the input above like this:

```js
const currying = (argument1) => (argument2) => (argument3) => (argument4) => (
  argument5
) => (argument6) => foo;
```

In both cases, this isn't ideal. We really want to keep the input as output
because it is more readable in this case. While Wadler's IR and renderer will
happily pretty-print any content, fine tuning the translation layer is the
complicated part.

## Conclusion

I know a lot more about code formatters than before. It is still quite limited
to one popular algorithm but I dug enough to understand some of the challenges
when it comes to pretty-printing content. This is a hard problem.

While implementing Wadler's algorithm isn't _that_ complicated (and we can find
many implementations), correctly handling comments and empty lines are crucial
and there isn't a popular algorithm for that. Prettier is a great framework to
build solid code formatters and it isn't limited to JavaScript: there are
plugins for many languages.

It sounds like I felt in love with Prettier or something. No, but knowing how it
really works and which problems it actually solves is super interesting and
mind-blowing to me.
