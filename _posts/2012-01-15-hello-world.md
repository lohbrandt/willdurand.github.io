Hi folks!

A few months ago, I decided to abandon my first blog at _www.willdurand.fr_.
Writing in French was great but writing in English sounds like a better
challenge.

That's why I'm starting this new blog, in English (as well-written as possible),
powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), [HTML5
Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and hosted on
[GitHub](http://www.github.com).

You'll get the code by browsing the following repository:
[willdurand.github.com](https://github.com/willdurand/willdurand.github.com).

William
