A few weeks ago, I wrote a CHIP-8 interpreter named
[_chipolata_](https://github.com/willdurand/chipolata) (you can take a look at
the [online demo here](https://williamdurand.fr/chipolata/)). This article gives
a quick tour of this project.

[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a programming language that
has been used to write video games on a few different platforms in the 70s-80s.
There are tons of interpreters already, and mine isn't fundamentally different I
believe.

## Context

One of my personal projects is a GameBoy emulator, which I initially started in
order to learn more about emulators, graphics and Rust. This GameBoy project is
currently unfinished and not publicly available. The truth is: I wasn't very
happy with some of the architecture decisions I made so I put it on hold. After
a year of inactivity, I decided to work on a similar but a lot simpler project
in order to (hopefully) solve some of my design issues and finish the emulator.
The _chipolata_ project was born.

I wrote _chipolata_ in Rust (a programming language I don't practice enough) and
it is split into three components:

- a core library that contains the actual interpreter
- a cross-platform "desktop" application
- a web application powered by a WebAssembly module

The next three sections will give more information about each of these
components.

## Core library

The core library parses the content of a ROM file, which contains [operation
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode) ("opcodes"). CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes
only but implementing all of them still takes time. I used a [test
ROM](https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom) to verify my implementation and
I ported a tiny debugger that I wrote for the GameBoy emulator in order to
double-check a few other things. Writing a debugger early in the process is
always a good idea and it is useful even when the set of opcodes is relatively
small.

An
[`Interpreter`](https://github.com/willdurand/chipolata/blob/e55bcf32a0d74c9db4b35b493576a3e27399f4e6/src/chip8/mod.rs#L7)
struct, which is a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern),
exposes everything required to implement a "frontend" program. It's worth
pointing out that the interpreter does not handle the main loop. Indeed, I
decided to leave this part to the frontend side because I found it easier to
make graphical output, sound and user input work together with the interpreter
when the frontend also controls the main loop.

The first frontend I implemented was the cross-platform desktop application.

## Desktop application

This is a separate program that relies on the core library and adds a graphical
output thanks to [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb) as well as audio
support _via_ [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio). The screenshot below
shows the display on the left side and a terminal running the built-in debugger
on the right side:

At this point, I could play different games and everything was working as I
expected so I decided to try something new.

## Web application

I created WebAssembly (WASM) "bindings" to expose the core library as a WASM
module, which could then be used in a web application. I am not super familiar
with WASM so this part took me a while to understand what was possible.

A new
[`JsInterpreter`](https://github.com/willdurand/chipolata/blob/e55bcf32a0d74c9db4b35b493576a3e27399f4e6/src/wasm_bindings.rs)
struct decorates the core `Interpreter` one and contains the configuration
needed to compile a WASM module. I used
[wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) to build the final npm
package and I recommend this tool!

The web application allows users to play _Space Invaders_ written by David
Winter. I didn't want to add other games because there are enough CHIP-8
interpreters online. Instead, I decided to implement different features such as
a live view of the CPU registers and a disassembler.

![](/images/posts/2021/01/chipolata-web.webp)

The disassembler implementation is pretty naive, though. It reads the entire RAM
starting at the start address (`0x200`) and, for each opcode, it prints a
mnemonic (from [this
list](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.1)). This disassembler
does not handle odd addresses (which are possible because the specification
allows unaligned instructions) and it does not make the distinction between code
and data sections. I think a recursive traversal approach would be much better.

This project was also a good opportunity to become more familiar with the [Web
Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
CHIP-8 only needs a single "beep" sound. I implemented it using a 400Hz sine
wave. Pretty cool what we can do in a browser these days!

## What's next?

First of all, I am pretty happy with the current state of this project.

I have some ideas for another rainy week-end without kids, though. For instance,
I would like to find a way to move the debugger to the core library in order to
implement it in the web application. The disassembler could also be rewritten in
Rust and become a core feature.

In the back of my mind, being able to run this interpreter on
[ArvernOS](https://github.com/willdurand/ArvernOS) would be a great achievement.
I haven't looked in details yet but I think it's doable ;-)
