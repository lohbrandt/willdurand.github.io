_Today is my second Moziversary. I joined Mozilla as a full-time employee on May
1st, 2018, not too long after contracting with them via my previous company._

I am part of the Firefox Add-ons team and I work on
[AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/), which is much more than "just a website". I
spent 2019 working on the [server
stack](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/) as well as creating and
deploying new security tools to cope with malicious activities. Everyone seems
happy with my work, I received positive feedback from my peers and manager and I
even "over-performed" last year. In 2020, I started to work on the Firefox
codebase and that's exciting!

Now, if I ask you to name the first thing about your current employer when you
think about it, what would it be? For me, and that might sound dumb but it is
the truth, my first thought is "Mozilla Firefox", that piece of software I
installed on every computer I could when I was 16-17 years old because "it was
much faster than Internet Explorer" and... free. That was in the early 2000s.

My father was working for the main telecommunications company in France back
then. Once my parents could afford a personal computer at home in the late 1990s
(an [IBM Aptiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Aptiva) <3), we were able to
get [56k Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0), then 128k
([ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network)) and
later DSL. That's how I met the Internet but it took me a few more years and bad
grades in high school to grow an interest in computers.

I never imagined that I could work for a company whose icon was sitting on the
Windows 98 Desktop of my parents' computer one day. And yet, here I am, and
that's why Mozilla is and will always be special to me. It's an immense part of
my teenager memories, it reminds me where I come from (including my privilege).

Contrary to many of my colleagues, I wasn't a
[volunteer](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/) before joining Mozilla
and I knew little to nothing about Mozilla Corporation. I was following some of
the Mozilla Foundation initiatives but I wasn't a
[Mozillian](https://mozillians.org). I fixed that since then ;-)

I am grateful to my current manager (who hired me) as well as all my colleagues
in the Add-ons team and beyond. They are all amazing folks! I learned tons of
things about everything, including myself, and these two years have been
absolutely fantastic. Thanks y'all!
