Last week-end, I started to play with
[ArvernOS](https://github.com/willdurand/ArvernOS) (my very own 64-bit kernel)
and one of the [Raspberry Pi
2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) I had in a
drawer (32-bit architecture unfortunately but that's a story for another time).

After a few hours, I was able to run ArvernOS with most features disabled on real
hardware (getting it to run in [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) was surprisingly
straightforward). In the following, I'll explain the boot sequence of a
Raspberry Pi 2 and show how it works using an example.

## Boot sequence

When we power on a Raspberry Pi 2, the CPU is not yet active, only the GPU
([VPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VideoCore)) is. The boot sequence is a
multi-stage sequence that loads and executes different programs sequentially.
The GPU starts by executing the _first stage_ bootloader stored on the board (in
ROM) which, among other things, will attempt to read the SD card and load the
_second stage_ bootloader named `bootcode.bin`. The code contained in
`bootcode.bin` will load the main (GPU) firmware named `start.elf` as well as
another file named `fixup.dat`, both located on the SD card. The latter is used
to configure the SDRAM depending on the hardware. The `start.elf` file contains
the code to display the rainbow splash when we have a screen connected to a
Raspberry Pi but its main task is to boot the CPUs and load the kernel code.

Both `bootcode.bin` and `start.elf` attempt to read a `config.txt` file, which
is an optional but extremely useful configuration file. For example, we can add
`uart_2ndstage=1` to this file to get diagnostic information on UART0 (serial
port). We can also specify the kernel code we want to run (the default kernel
file being `kernel7.img` on a Raspberry Pi 2).

## Quick example with U-Boot

Let's try to compile and execute [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) to
understand how things work. U-Boot is a fairly small bootloader used in many
embedded devices, and it normally attempts to load an actual Operating System.
U-Boot runs a command-line interface on a serial port too so we're going to
leverage this feature and only load U-Boot.

First, we need to download the `bootcode.bin`, `fixup.dat` and `start.elf` files
from [this repo](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot) and
put them on the main
[FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#FAT32) partition of
a SD card. These files are provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which means
most of the early boot sequence is done for us. I know about [this alternative
_second stage_ bootloader
project](https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware) but I am not sure why
we'd use it to be honest.

```
$ ls /Volumes/SDCARD/
bootcode.bin*  fixup.dat*  start.elf*
```

The next step is more interesting. We need something for the `start.elf` program
to complete successfully. In this example, we want to use U-Boot so let's
compile it. I personally used the Docker-based [ArvernOS
toolchain](https://github.com/willdurand/ArvernOS/tree/77910ccd44608c683423b2bed1e90d5b050923d7#docker-recommended-way)
for that:

```
$ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
$ cd u-boot
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app willos/toolchain make rpi_2_defconfig
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app willos/toolchain make
  [...]

  LD      u-boot
  OBJCOPY u-boot.srec
  OBJCOPY u-boot-nodtb.bin
  SYM     u-boot.sym
  COPY    u-boot.bin
```

Once finished, we can move the generated `u-boot.bin` file to the SD card as
well. We're almost there, all we need is to create the `config.txt` file with
the following content on the SD card:

```ini
# Output debug information from `bootcode.bin` and `start.elf`
uart_2ndstage=1
# Configure which file should be loaded by `start.elf`
kernel=u-boot.bin
```

The SD card should now have five files:

```
$ ls /Volumes/SDCARD/
bootcode.bin*  config.txt*  fixup.dat*  start.elf*  u-boot.bin*
```

Let's connect a USB to TTL serial cable
([FTDI](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=ftdi)) between the Raspberry Pi 2 and our
main computer. We can now open the serial port (with `screen -L
/dev/tty.usbserial-A900HHN1 115200` for instance), put the SD card in the Pi and
power it on.

After a few seconds, we should see the debug information from the boot sequence
first:

I did not have a monitor connected when I ran this example so there were a few
HDMI related errors. Near the end, we can read the following lines:

```
MESS:00:00:01.555553:0: brfs: File read: /mfs/sd/u-boot.bin
MESS:00:00:01.559432:0: Loading 'u-boot.bin' to 0x8000 size 0x76ea4
```

Shortly after U-Boot should write to the serial port too and we can enter the
built-in shell by pressing a key:

```

```

Sweet!

From there, we can print the U-Boot version:

```
U-Boot> version

GNU ld (GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 10-2020-q4-major) 2.35.1.20201028
```

Last but not least, the board has two built-in LEDs (power and activity) and we
definitely need to blink LEDs ;-) We can toggle the activity LED with the
following U-Boot command (GPIO `47` controls the activity LED):

```
U-Boot> gpio toggle 47
gpio: pin 47 (gpio 47) value is 1
U-Boot> gpio toggle 47
gpio: pin 47 (gpio 47) value is 0
```

## Loading our own code

`u-boot.bin` contains the code to run on the Raspberry Pi 2 and we can replace
this file with our own code if we want too. There are two important pieces of
information:

1. `start.elf` will load and execute the code at `0x8000` by default (we usually
   configure this base address during the linking phase).
2. when control is transferred to the "user" code, the CPU is in `HYP` mode
   (Hypervisor) and depending on our needs, we may want to switch back to `SVC`
   mode (Supervisor).

We can write a few lines of assembly and a bit of C to blink LEDs. I created [a
Gist](https://gist.github.com/willdurand/614ad3ad1cac0189691f67c0ac71b9e6) with
all the files necessary to build a minimal bare metal program that blinks the
activity LED indefinitely. Once compiled, we can transfer `kernel7.img` to the
SD card and update the `config.txt` file to point to `kernel7.img` instead of
`u-boot.bin` (or remove the line since it is the default value).

## "Stage 3" bootloader

Many projects have their own bootloader to transfer programs using a serial
cable and avoid the annoying SD card dance. Such "stage 3" bootloaders are quite
simple.

First, a bootloader relocates itself to a higher address in RAM. This is
required to be able to load the actual kernel code later. Then, it initializes a
serial port (UART0 or UART1 on the Raspberry Pi), send a special sequence and
wait for a reply. This special sequence should be received by a program running
on the other computer, which should push the new code to the bootloader. Once
downloaded and stored in memory, the bootloader should call the new code.

This is what I have implemented too. Sneak peek:
