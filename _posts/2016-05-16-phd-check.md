[Three years ago]({% post_url 2013-01-02-new-year-new-life-new-job %}), I
started a PhD. I am happy to let _the Internetsâ„¢_ know that I successfully
defended it two weeks ago! I can now officially call myself a doctor (LOL).

In case you're interested or simply curious, you can download the manuscript
here: [Automated Test Generation for production systems with a Model-based
Testing approach](/papers/phd-thesis-v2.pdf). The slides I used for my defense
are below:
