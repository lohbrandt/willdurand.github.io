It's been [a year since I changed the way I deal with my Internet
presence][post-internet]. I would like to share some updates in this article.
In short, I am pretty satisfied with my current setup but a few things could
be improved.

I am more than happy with [Fastmail][] (affiliate link) for emails, calendars
and contacts. It works very well! It has everything I ever needed and the
support team has been amazing! The only missing feature is that, when sending
a calendar invite from my phone or laptop, it uses my Fastmail email address
(`account@fastmail.com`) instead of the email with my own domain. This should
be supported soon, though.

I don't use any Instant Messaging application anymore (I was using Google Talk
before). Instead, I rely on emails and SMS. There is [Slack](https://slack.com/)
now too :-) I started to use [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), which is
owned by Facebook now, ugh! Not my best choice but it is a bit like fighting
against Skype with family/friends, it is a tough job.

Another "complicated battle" is related to the use of encrypted emails. I still
send more clear text emails than encrypted ones. It is a bit sad but no a huge
surprise, I guess. I don't think people care enough about privacy and GPG is
complicated. On the same topic, I don't use [iPGMail](https://ipgmail.com/)
on my iPhone anymore.

A few months ago, I bought a [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for
my place. I wanted to try self-hosting, _i.e._ hosting _my_ server and thus
keeping _my_ data and _my_ services at home. I first installed [Tiny Tiny
RSS](https://tt-rss.org/), the best RSS feed reader ever! The feature I love is
the daily email digest. Every morning, I get an email at 8am, offering a few
links to read. Because there is an abstract for each link, I can skip those I am
not interested in so that I do not spend too much time reading.

I am also self-hosting a Pastebin-like called [ZeroBin][] and [ownCloud][].
ownCloud 8 is amazingly stable and fast and it is now possible to replace
Dropbox (or Drive). It can also be used to self-host calendars and contacts.
I don't want to self-host my emails though. Emails are rather critical and
should not be unavailable for too long.

At work, we chose to use ownCloud to self-host most of our tools, including
files, calendars, and contacts. I may consider moving my personal calendars and
contacts from Fastmail to my ownCloud instance as well. We'll see. In case you
don't want to manage your "own" ownCloud, there are countless providers. In
France, I would recommend [Framadrive][].

Last but not least, I keep using [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com),
likely the only web application that I am not self-hosting at the moment.
[Wallabag][] seems more and more what I need, though. I don't know why I am
still relying on Instapaper instead of Wallabag, maybe because changing habits
is hard?

One more thing by the way... I did not find any [Disqus][] alternative yet :-(
