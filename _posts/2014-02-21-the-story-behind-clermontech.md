A year ago, [Julien](https://twitter.com/themouette),
[Pierre](https://twitter.com/krichprollsch),
[Manuel](https://twitter.com/manuraynaud),
[Jean-Philippe](https://twitter.com/jeanphix),
[Julien](https://twitter.com/julienmaupetit) (yes, again), and I created
[**Clermont'ech**](http://clermontech.org/), a non-for-profit organization which
aimed at **gathering developers** in our lovely city. We decided to organize
conferences every two months, the so-called [API
Hours](http://clermontech.org/api-hours/).

My first conferences as an attendee were Symfony Live 2011, and the
[ParisJS](http://parisjs.org/) events when I was living in Paris. That was an
**eye-opener**! Back to Clermont-Fd (my place), I talked to some of my friends
about the idea of organizing conferences [here, between the
volcanos](https://twitter.com/cedlab/status/435870905126768641). Unfortunately,
we were all quite busy, and nothing happened. This was in 2011.

Then, I moved to Switzerland, where I learnt what **simplicity** and **freedom**
were: _Wanna do something? Well, just do it!_ In other words, if you never try
you will never know. Back to my place again, I then met [Julien
](https://twitter.com/julienmaupetit) who wanted to build a Python community:

Yeah, there are not a lot of Pythonistas here. However, there are PHP,
[Java](https://twitter.com/lavajug), .NET,
[JavaScript](https://twitter.com/clermontjs) guys. Hence the idea of not being
focused on a single technology or programming language, but rather, targeting
developers at large. That is how [Clermont'ech](http://clermontech.org) is born,
exactly a year ago. Julien was really a catalyst, and it was the right moment I
guess. We discussed the idea with [the](https://twitter.com/tmaurel)
[LavaJUG](https://twitter.com/pcolomb) [guys](https://twitter.com/coupelon)
(Java User Group), the first local tech organization, and they helped us a lot,
giving valuable advices.

The first thing we did was to all agree on a **manifesto** with **four strong
values**:

- **openness**: we are technology-agnostic, even C++ guys can join the flock;
- **independence**: we are not tied to any company or organization, no matter
  how much they could give us (well, it is worth mentioning that [16 billion
  dollars seems to be the "fuck you"
  price](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/436265430005448704), so ...);
- **respect**: basically, people who stir up trouble are not welcomed;
- **sharing**: every decision we make is driven by this value, we don't just
  promote sharing through the conferences.

A year later, I think that this was our main key success factor. We always stick
to this manifesto, we had a **clear vision** since the beginning, and we all
shared the same point of view.

Then, we tried to create our own identity, and we choose the platypus as our
mascot. _Why?_ Because, platypus are cool, and will always be cool. End of
story. A special thanks goes to [Sophie](https://twitter.com/agou), our
outstanding web designer, by the way.

First event was awesome, while we had no money, no experience in organizing an
event, only a MacBook Pro, and a camera. We got more attendees than expected,
quite unbelievable. Next API Hours went well, and we reached our limit of 50
attendees after the second event. The idea behind **limiting the number of
attendees** was pretty straightforward: **we wanted people to meet other
people**, and make the events more **friendly**.

We were more and more prepared, with more equipement, and a lot of **goodies**!
That is probably the second key success factor: **focusing on the marketing
stuff**. This led us to the notion of sponsorship, i.e. **money**. Since the
beginning, we wanted our events to be _free of charge_ for the attendees, but
also, providing food (we are French afterall). Thanks to our fabulous sponsors,
we were able to do more, making
[t-shirts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96523012@N07/10455746815/in/set-72157636366078485),
[stickers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96523012@N07/10696881453/in/set-72157637356442883),
[business
cards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96523012@N07/10696880443/in/set-72157637356442883),
postcards, but also
[**chocolates**](https://twitter.com/disk_91/status/413000570027667457/photo/1)!

We held the events in **different places**, and not always the same day of week,
so that we allowed new people to come. We took care of a lot of similar
**details** (e.g. food for vegans and non-pork eaters, live streaming for those
who didn't get a ticket, and many more you can't probably think of).

But, conferences without speakers are nothing. We wanted the API Hours to be
**community-driven**, and that is why we decided to find
[speakers](http://clermontech.org/talks/) locally. Most of our speakers never
spoke at any conference before, but they were all good!

Thanks to these events, I met a lot of interesting people, and not only
developers, but I also heard about topics I would not have explored myself. We
built a community of ~130 people (based on our mailing-list), all involved in
computing. I think we are quite well-known now, since local universities asked
us to come and speak to their students. 2014 is going to be amazing, we have a
lot of new plans to make things even better!

If you don't have any tech organization in your place, consider building your
own! It is worth doing it, and a **fantastic adventure**!
