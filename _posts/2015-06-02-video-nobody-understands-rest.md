Last month, I gave a talk on why nobody understands REST at [PHP Tour Luxembourg
2015](www.afup.org/pages/phptourluxembourg2015/). In other words, I explained
how complicated was REST and how impractical it was in real life (with concrete
examples), but I also gave pointers on how to build powerful and pragmatic web
APIs.

As usual, congratulations to the [AFUP](https://twitter.com/afup) team, this
event was a blast!

You will find the video of my talk below (in French, sorry):
