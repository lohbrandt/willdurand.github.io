Heya, I'm glad to announce that I will be speaking at [Symfony Live 2012][sf-live]
in Paris on June 7-8th, 2012.

I will introduce [Propel2][], the new upcoming version of the [Propel ORM][].
I will probably explain the Propel philosophy and then more details about how
Propel works in real life, how it's built, and some other things you will discover
if you attend my talk.

To be honest, it will be my very first talk at a conference so I decided to do it
in French. I know some people complained about that but I'm not comfortable enough
with my English level to give a talk in English. That being said, I will write my
slides in English. That way, it should still be possible for those who don't speak
French to follow my presentation.

Hope to see you there!
