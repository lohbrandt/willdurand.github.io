This week, I launched [jenairienacacher.fr](http://jenairienacacher.fr/), a
website explaining what is wrong with the _"nothing to hide"_ argument, and
providing information, data, and facts on this topic. This is my first project
written in French (as far as I can remember), however
[Guyzmo](https://twitter.com/guyzmo) made [an English version of the
content](https://lite5.framapad.org/p/nothing-to-hide).

I know quite a lot of people who think they don't have anything to hide because
they are honests and they respect the law. I was a bit tired to always repeat
myself, to always find the same articles and studies to prove they did not
realize what it meant to say _"I've got nothing to hide"_. I was not aware of
any online resource that aimed at gathering as much information as possible,
and written in French. Then, earlier this month,
[Kevin](https://twitter.com/KPhoen) asked [Twitter for arguments to explain the
issue to his mom](https://twitter.com/KPhoen/status/555080357771345920). This
project was born.

What I started to do was basic: aggregating information from various places, and
trying to come up with a website. However, **this would not have been possible
without the help of [Vincent](https://twitter.com/mazenovi)**. Yes, it would not
have even existed. To be honest, convincing him was the most complicated challenge to
me. But as soon as I explained him the project, he was willing to take part in
it! After a few weeks of work, we were able to release a first version!

On the first day, more than 8000 unique visitors browsed
[jenairienacacher.fr](http://jenairienacacher.fr) (thanks
[Geoffrey](https://twitter.com/ubermuda) for the Piwik instance). I [tweeted the
link](https://twitter.com/couac/status/560732693986824195) in the morning, and a
couple hours after, I submitted it to [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8965142). It stayed on the home page
for several hours, which is amazing given that the website is written in French.
Someone submitted the website on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/) too,
and it has been quite popular as well. All in all, this project got **positive
feedback**, way more than expected to be honest. We now have even more work and
ideas to make this website better!
